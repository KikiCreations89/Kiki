Kimmy Kitty – Frontend Portfolio
Welcome to my frontend portfolio! This repository showcases a selection of interactive web projects built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, emphasizing responsive design, mobile-first principles, and clean code.

I am a Personal Support Worker (PSW) transitioning into tech. My experience has given me skills in patience, attention to detail, problem-solving, and empathy, which I bring into building thoughtful, user-friendly, and accessible web applications.
