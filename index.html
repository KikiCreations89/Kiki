      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a personal suppoort worker that takes care of the elderly with dementia and alzheimers. I recently took on a course for responsive web design. I have learned html, typography basics and still in the midst of finishing CSS. I am very organized and use logical thinking at all times.  I am always open to learning more. My plans are to learn Front and Back-End Development as well as Python and Javascript. I have a strong interest in Web Design and Development. I have no experience in this field as of yet, but I would like to learn from other developers to gain experience and knowledge.</p>
